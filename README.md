* **Intro**
    * [OHSU](https://twitter.com/@OHSUNews)
    
    * [Robin Champieux](https://twitter.com/rchampieux) is the Scholarly Communication Librarian at Oregon Health & Science University.  She leads efforts that contribute to the pace and impact of scholarly communication by partnering with OHSU research, teaching, and student communities on issues relating to publication, public access, data sharing, and scientific contribution.  She is a passionate advocate for open science and the success of early career researchers.
    
    * [Danielle Robinson](https://twitter.com/daniellecrobins) is a 2016 Mozilla Fellow for Science with PhD in Neuroscience from Oregon Health and Science University. She is an experienced scientist, community builder, and technical communicator. She is passionate about applying the philosophy of open source software development to scientific research to improve efficiency and research reproducibility. Danielle received a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and has a strong record of leadership, mentorship, and policy work. She is a founding member of Women in Science Portland and OHSU BioData Club and has collaborated on projects including Science Hack Day Portland, Open Insight PDX, Mozilla's Working Open Workshop, and Radian Data.

    * **Open Science** is an umbrella term that refers to the application of open principles to scientific practice. It includes Open Access, Open Data, Open Educational Resources (OERs), Open Source, citizen science, and equity, diversity and inclusion in research. 

* **D to R: When you think back to what we have built over the last three years, what were the pivotal moments from your perspective?**


* **R to D: What made you come and what made you stick around?**
  - Danielle: I was in my 3rd year of a PhD program and feeling disillusioned. I saw a flyer Robin had posted for a round table event on science publishing. The event was really engaging, and I felt inspired to learn more about the open movement. After I went to that roundtable, I was at a Grad Student Organization meeting and heard about the Library sponsoring travel to OpenCon and applied. That experience galvanized my involvement in the open movement. Read more [here](https://science.mozilla.org/blog/opencon-an-unexpected-journey) on my journey to open science. 

* **D to R: How have you gained traction with researchers?** 
    * Partnerships
        * What student groups and early career researcher groups are already working in the science equity, access space?
        * Partner with them on events and resources
            * be willing to cede control
            * support and speak to their vision (Science Hack day)
            * be flexible and open to unusual collaborations (a long term collaborator was brought on last min by another speaker)
            *
    * Learning opportunities that impact researchers' success 
        * BioData Club - addressing gaps in the PhD student curriculum
            * Learned about this 2 years ago from students
            * Using skill building that can help people in their lab right now. Their motivation is to do better work, graduate faster, impress their PI.  These skills are also foundational to open science and/or executed through open science tools and platforms (e.g Github, R, etc.)
                * BioData Club
            * Providing professional dev opportunities, otherwise wouldn't have access to.
                * OpenCon
                * miniWOW 
                    * vital project management and strategy skills students won't get mentoring on from anywhere else
                * Impact workshops
    * Making it fun 
        * Fun gets people in the door
        * Help the people who want to be champions find the energy to keep coming back.
        * Reconnecting people to why they decided to devote themselves to science in the first place.
        * Example:  Science Hack Day


* How do you find your people
    * Who is working to make science and academia better, more inclusive, more equitable? We reached out to them. 
        * Women in Science PDX, Alliance for Visible diversity, Women who Code, Open Hardware, Open Source community, Department specific study groups, Grad Students association and Postdoc Office.
        * All scientists, but don't necessarily know what open science is or why they might care
        * Antionette story

* How do we measure success?
    * Community engagement
        * We are building a community of open science practitioners
        * We want to policies to grown from the community
        * We are getting the people on board first
        * Draw connection to open source.
