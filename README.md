### A discussion between collaborators [Robin Champieux](https://twitter.com/rchampieux) and [Danielle Robinson](https://twitter.com/daniellecrobins)

* **Intro**
    * [OHSU](https://twitter.com/@OHSUNews) is reseach intensive biomedical university in Portland, Oregon.  In additional to a clinical enterprise and teaching hospitals, the campus includes schools of medicine, nursing, dentistry, public health, and a college of pharmacy.  
    
    * [Robin Champieux](https://twitter.com/rchampieux) is the Scholarly Communication Librarian at Oregon Health & Science University.  She leads efforts that contribute to the pace and impact of research communication by partnering with OHSU research, teaching, and student communities on issues relating to publication, public access, data sharing, scientific contribution, and impact.  She is a passionate advocate for open science and the success of early career researchers.  She is a founding member of OHSU BioData Club and has collaborated on projects including Science Hack Day Portland, Open Insight PDX, Radian Data, Metrics Toolkit, and the [Scholarly Commons](https://www.force11.org/group/scholarly-commons-working-group/wp1-self-critique). 
    
    * [Danielle Robinson](https://twitter.com/daniellecrobins) is a 2016 Mozilla Fellow for Science with PhD in Neuroscience from Oregon Health and Science University. She is an experienced scientist, community builder, and technical communicator. She is passionate about applying the philosophy of open source software development to scientific research to improve efficiency and research reproducibility. Danielle received a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and has a strong record of leadership, mentorship, and policy work. She is a founding member of Women in Science Portland and OHSU BioData Club and has collaborated on projects including Science Hack Day Portland, Open Insight PDX, Mozilla's Working Open Workshop, and Radian Data.

    * **Open Science** is an umbrella term that refers to the application of open principles to scientific practice and communication. It includes Open Access, Open Data, Open Educational Resources (OERs), Open Source, citizen science, and equity, diversity and inclusion in research. 

* **Danielle to Robin: When you think back to what we have built over the last three years, what were the pivotal moments from your perspective?**
   * Robin:  A couple milestones stand-out for me.  Three years ago, I worked with my colleagues Jackie Wirz and Melissa Haendel to host a roundtable forum for students and postdocs to discuss issues related to scholarly and research communication.  We invited clinical and basic science faculty on campus who are advocates for open science practices, providing students the change to have an actual coversation about the connections between open practices, personal success, the pace of discovery, and public scientific engagment and trust.  Their questions very much drove the content of the forum, and gave me a lot of insight into how to frame future programming to pique students' and early career researcher's interests.
   
   * In 2015 I secured a grant from the National Library of Medicince to support Open Insight, a project I founded to catalyze student and researcher engagment with open science through hands-on learning and face-to-face interactions with leaders in the field.  That funding and the project as a whole was the impetus for many of the collaborations I've developed, including with you and the OHSU computational commutnity.  Additional the professional development opportunities we were able to provide via this project really cemented my understanding of the need and desire for such events, giving us a continuing framework for much of our advocacy and community building work on campus and beyond.  

* **Robin to Danielle: What made you come and what made you stick around?**
  - Danielle: I was in my 3rd year of a PhD program and feeling disillusioned. I saw a flyer Robin had posted for a round table event on science publishing. The event was really engaging, and I felt inspired to learn more about the open movement. After I went to that roundtable, I was at a Grad Student Organization meeting and heard about the Library sponsoring travel to OpenCon and applied. That experience galvanized my involvement in the open movement. Read more [here](https://science.mozilla.org/blog/opencon-an-unexpected-journey) on my journey to open science. 

* **Danielle to Robin: How have you gained traction with researchers?** 
    * We've developed partnerships with groups who are already working on issues related to equity, accademic access, continuting education, and advocacy in science. 
        * What student groups and early career researcher groups are you working with on campus?
            * At OHSU: Women in Science Portland, Bioinformatics Discussion Group, Python Summer Club, Alliance for Visible Diversity at OHSU, OHSU Grad Student Association, Data Jamboree
        * We've partnered with them on events and resources.  In doing so, we've developed a few important strategies:
            * Be willing to cede control!
            * Support and speak to our research and student collaborators' vision (Science Hack day).
            * Be flexible and open to unusual collaborations (one long term collaborator was brought on last min by another speaker).
            * Find them where they are (twitter, GitHub, on-campus student events).
            * Small pockets of funding go a long way.
            
    * Provide learning opportunities that impact researchers' success 
            * Using skill building that can help people in their lab right now. Their motivation is to do better work, graduate faster, impress their PI.  These skills are also foundational to open science and/or executed through open science tools and platforms (e.g Github, R, etc.)
            * For example: [BioData Club](https://biodata-club.github.io/) - addressing gaps in the PhD student curriculum
    
         * Providing professional dev opportunities, students and researchers otherwise wouldn't have access to.
              * [OpenCon](http://www.opencon2017.org/) travel awards for students
              * [miniWOW PDX](https://daniellecrobinson.github.io/mini-wow-pdx/) 
                 * vital project management and strategy skills students won't get mentoring on from anywhere else
              * [Impact workshops](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/library/services/Impact-Challenge-Workshops.cfm)
              
    * Make it fun 
        * Gets people in the door
        * Helpss the people who want to be champions find the energy to keep coming back.
        * Reconnecting people to why they decided to devote themselves to science in the first place.
        * Example:  [Science Hack Day](http://portland.sciencehackday.org/)


* How do you find your people
    * Ask who is working to make science and academia better, more inclusive, more equitable? Reach out to them. 
        * Women in Science PDX, Alliance for Visible Diversity, Women Who Code PDX, PyLadies PDX, Open Hardware, Hack Oregon, other open Source community groups outside OHSU, smaller department-specific study groups (Python Summer Club, Bioinformatics Discussion Group), OHSU Grad Student Organization, and Postdoc Office.
        * All of these groups are run by scientists, but they don't necessarily know what open science is or why they might care. 
        
* How do we measure success?
    * Community engagement
        * We are building a community of open science practitioners
        * We want and are strategizing the policies to grow from the community
        * We are getting the people on board first
        * This is not unlike open source development.
